#Ping Pong Assessment

##Epicodus week 3 code review

###By: Jordan Meier

###Description
This week's code review project is a website where a user can input a number and have a range of numbers from 1 to their entered number returned in a list. Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with the word "ping", numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong", and numbers divisible by both are replaced with "pingpong". I opted to attempt to recreate the pictured example layout without using bootstrap.
